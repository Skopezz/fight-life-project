            <h2>Wrestling</h2>
            <p>
              Wrestling, a fundamental component of mixed martial arts (MMA), is
              a dynamic and physically demanding sport that emphasizes skill,
              technique, and strength. Rooted in ancient history and adapted for
              modern competition, wrestling serves as a cornerstone for fighters
              seeking success in the diverse world of MMA. Wrestling in MMA
              involves a blend of grappling, takedowns, and ground control,
              making it an essential discipline for fighters aiming to dominate
              their opponents in various positions. Wrestlers are adept at
              utilizing their body positioning, leverage, and superior
              conditioning to dictate the pace of a bout and secure advantageous
              positions

            <h2>Muay Thai</h2>
            <p>
              Muay Thai or Thai Boxing, is one of the most widely respected
              forms of stand up fighting (also known as “striking”) in the
              world. Unlike in boxing, Muay Thai fighters can make full use of
              punches, elbows, kicks, knees and clinch work to neutralise their
              opponents. As well as a very effective fighting style Muay Thai is
              a lot of fun and a tremendous work-out.

            <h2>Yoga</h2>
            <p>
              The beauty of yoga is that you don’t have to be a yogi or yogini
              to reap the benefits. Whether you are young or old, yoga has the
              power to calm the mind and strengthen the body.
              At Fight Life, we practice Vinyasa yoga. Vinyasa is an approach to
              yoga in which you move from one pose directly into the next.
              There's a flow to a Vinyasa yoga session.
