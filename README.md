There are differences from the wireframes to the finished website:
  * The final web page has 4 navigation links in total: Home, Our Club, Classes and Contact.
  * There is no "What we offer" section on home page
  * There is no timetable page

The color scheme for the majority of the website were black and white, blacks used for the background and white for text. The occasional light blue, coral and red were used for headings and links.
